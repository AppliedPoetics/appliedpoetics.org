# Applied Poetics (AP)
This is the live code for the Applied Poetics constrained writing platform. It's backed up somewhat intermittently, but at least on a weekly basis.

AP exists as both a development platform for new writing constraints made possible by computers and computational methods, in addition to serving as a new home for restored utilities and routines that may have become deprecated for many reasons (or may have never been online in the first place).

It is a labor of love done by a somewhat out-of-practice coder (Doug Luman) who is a student at George Mason University in the MFA in poetry. This is how he composes nearly everything he writes. The origin of these utilities traces to a 2014 project by the Found Poetry Review entitled the "Oulipost"; many users were seeking time-saving ways to implement procedural constraints originated by the OuLiPo ("Ouvroir de litt√©rature potentielle," or "Workshop of Potential Literature"). Not all of their various generation methods have been translated, but many more will be.

More than anything, this project is posted here as an archive, but also as a way to share the how/when of ways into basic computational poetics. Think of it as a journal of learning on Doug's behalf.

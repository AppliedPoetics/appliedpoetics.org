			Today's major update brings login functionality to appliedpoetics.org. As of this update, you may connect your Facebook or Google account to appliedpoetics.org, allowing you to save source texts for later use. The login feature is available on the main toolbar, replacing the button which formerly linked to our bug tracking system. The save and load features appear in the lower-right as part of the windows control box.

			If you were a user of the bug tracking system, please update your bookmarks to reflect its new location: <a href= 'http://mantis.appliedpoetics.org' target='_new'>mantis.appliedpoetics.org</a>.

if __name__ == "__main__": undemonstrative at the best, and even his 
friendship seemed to be main(sys.argv[1:]) founded in a similar 
catholicity of good-nature. It is the mark of a modest man to accept 
his friendly circle ready-made from the hands of opportunity; and that 
was the lawyer's way. His friends were those of his own blood or those 
whom he had known the longest; his affections, like ivy, were the 
growth of time, they implied no aptness in the object. Hence, no 
doubt, the bond that united him to Mr. Richard Enfield, his distant 
kinsman, the well-known man about town. It was a nut to crack for 
many, what these two could see in each other, or what subject they 
could find in common. It was reported by those who encountered them in 
their Sunday walks, that they said nothing, looked singularly dull, 
and would hail with obvious relief the appearance of a friend. For all 
that, the two men put the greatest store by these excursions, counted 
them the chief jewel of each week, and not only set aside occasions of 
pleasure, but even resisted the calls 3) of business, that they might 
enjoy them uninterrupted. It chanced on one of these rambles that 
their way led them down a by-street in a busy quarter of London. The 
street was small and what is called quiet, but it drove a thriving 
trade on the week-days. The inhabitants were all doing well, it 
seemed, and all emulously hoping to do better still, and laying out 
the surplus of their gains in coquetry; so that the shop fronts stood 
along that thoroughfare with an air of invitation, like rows of 
smiling saleswomen. Even on Sunday, when it veiled its more florid 
charms and lay comparatively empty of passage, the street shone out in 
contrast to its dingy neighbourhood, like a fire in a forest; and with 
its freshly painted shutters, well-polished brasses, and general 
cleanliness and gaiety of note, instantly caught and pleased the eye 
of the passenger. Two doors from one corner, on the left hand going 
east, the line was broken by the entry of a court; and just at that 
point, a certain sinister block of building thrust forward its gable 
on the street. It was two stories high; showed no window, nothing but 
a door on the lower story and a blind forehead of discoloured wall on 
the upper; and bore in every feature, the marks of prolonged and 
sordid negligence. The door, which was equipped with neither bell nor 
knocker, was blistered and distained. Tramps slouched into the recess 
and struck matches on 4) the panels; children kept shop upon the 
steps; the schoolboy had tried his knife on the mouldings; and for 
close on a generation, no one had appeared to drive away these random 
visitors or to repair their ravages. Mr. Enfield and the lawyer were 
on the other side of the by-street; but when they came abreast of the 
entry, the former lifted up his cane and pointed. "Did you ever remark 
that door?" he asked; and when his companion had replied in the 
affirmative, "It is connected in my mind," added he, "with a very odd 
story." "Indeed?" said Mr. Utterson, with a slight change of voice, 
"and what was that?" "Well, it was this way," returned Mr. Enfield: "I 
was coming home from some place at the end of the world, about three 
o'clock of a black winter morning, and my way lay through a part of 
town where there was literally nothing to be seen but lamps. Street 
after street, and all the folks asleep--street after street, all 
lighted up as if for a procession and all as empty as a church--till 
at last I got into that state of mind when a man listens and listens 
and begins to long for the sight of a policeman. All at once, I saw 
two figures: one a little man who was stumping along eastward at a 
good walk, and the other a girl of maybe eight or ten who was running 
as hard as she was able down a cross street. Well, sir, the two ran 
into one another naturally enough at the 5) corner; and then came the 
horrible part of the thing; for the man trampled calmly over the 
child's body and left her screaming on the ground. It sounds nothing 
to hear, but it was hellish to see. It wasn't like a man; it was like 
some damned Juggernaut. I gave a view-halloa, took to my heels, 
collared my gentleman, and brought him back to where there was already 
quite a group about the screaming child. He was perfectly cool and 
made no resistance, but gave me one look, so ugly that it brought out 
the sweat on me like running. The people who had turned out were the 
girl's own family; and pretty soon, the doctor, for whom she had been 
sent, put in his appearance. Well, the child was not much the worse, 
more frightened, according to the Sawbones; and there you might have 
supposed would be an end to it. But there was one curious 
circumstance. I had taken a loathing to my gentleman at first sight. 
So had the child's family, which was only natural. But the doctor's 
case was what struck me. He was the usual cut-and-dry apothecary, of 
no particular age and colour, with a strong Edinburgh accent, and 
about as emotional as a bagpipe. Well, sir, he was like the rest of 
us; every time he looked at my prisoner, I saw that Sawbones turn sick 
and white with the desire to kill him. I knew what was in his mind, 
just as he knew what was in mine; and killing being out of the 
question, we did the next best. We told the man we could 6) and would 
make such a scandal out of this, as should make his name stink from 
one end of London to the other. If he had any friends or any credit, 
we undertook that he should lose them. And all the time, as we were 
pitching it in red hot, we were keeping the women off him as best we 
could, for they were as wild as harpies. I never saw a circle of such 
hateful faces; and there was the man in the middle, with a kind of 
black, sneering coolness--frightened too, I could see that--but 
carrying it off, sir, really like Satan. 'If you choose to make 
capital out of this accident,' said he, 'I am naturally helpless. No 
gentleman but wishes to avoid a scene,' says he. 'Name your figure.' 
Well, we screwed him up to a hundred pounds for the child's family; he 
would have clearly liked to stick out; but there was something about 
the lot of us that meant mischief, and at last he struck. The next 
thing was to get the money; and where do you think he carried us but 
to that place with the door?-- whipped out a key, went in, and 
presently came back with the matter of ten pounds in gold and a cheque 
for the balance on Coutts's, drawn payable to bearer and signed with a 
name that I can't mention, though it's one of the points of my story, 
but it was a name at least very well known and often printed. The 
figure was stiff; but the signature was good for more than that, if it 
was only genuine. I took the liberty of pointing out to my gentleman 
that the whole 7) business looked apocryphal, and that a man does not, 
in real life, walk into a cellar door at four in the morning and come 
out of it with another man's cheque for close upon a hundred pounds. 
But he was quite easy and sneering. 'Set your mind at rest,' says he, 
'I will stay with you till the banks open and cash the cheque myself.' 
So we all set off, the doctor, and the child's father, and our friend 
and myself, and passed the rest of the night in my chambers; and next 
day, when we had breakfasted, went in a body to the bank. I gave in 
the check myself, and said I had every reason to believe it was a 
forgery. Not a bit of it. The cheque was genuine." "Tut-tut," said Mr. 
Utterson. "I see you feel as I do," said Mr. Enfield. "Yes, it's a bad 
story. For my man was a fellow that nobody could have to do with, a 
really damnable man; and the person that drew the cheque is the very 
pink of the proprieties, celebrated too, and (what makes it worse) one 
of your fellows who do what they call good. Black-mail, I suppose; an 
honest man paying through the nose for some of the capers of his 
youth. Black-Mail House is what I call that place with the door, in 
consequence. Though even that, you know, is far from explaining all," 
he added, and with the words fell into a vein of musing. From this he 
was recalled by Mr. Utterson asking rather suddenly: "And you don't 
know if the drawer of the cheque lives there?" 8) "A likely place, 
isn't it?" returned Mr. Enfield. "But I happen to have noticed his 
address; he lives in some square or other." "And you never asked about 
the--place with the door?" said Mr. Utterson. "No, sir: I had a 
delicacy," was the reply. "I feel very strongly about putting 
questions; it partakes too much of the style of the day of judgment. 
You start a question, and it's like starting a stone. You sit quietly 
on the top of a hill; and away the stone goes, starting others; and 
presently some bland old bird (the last you would have thought of) is 
knocked on the head in his own back-garden and the family have to 
change their name. No, sir, I make it a rule of mine: the more it 
looks like Queer Street, the less I ask." "A very good rule, too," 
said the lawyer. "But I have studied the place for myself," continued 
Mr. Enfield. "It seems scarcely a house. There is no other door, and 
nobody goes in or out of that one but, once in a great while, the 
gentleman of my adventure. There are three windows looking on the 
court on the first floor; none below; the windows are always shut but 
they're clean. And then there is a chimney which is generally smoking; 
so somebody must live there. And yet it's not so sure; for the 
buildings are so packed together about that court, that it's hard to 
say where one ends and another begins." 9) The pair walked on again 
for a while in silence; and then, "Enfield," said Mr. Utterson, 
"that's a good rule of yours." "Yes, I think it is," returned Enfield. 
"But for all that," continued the lawyer, "there's one point I want to 
ask: I want to ask the name of that man who walked over the child." 
"Well," said Mr. Enfield, "I can't see what harm it would do. It was a 
man of the name of Hyde." "H'm," said Mr. Utterson. "What sort of a 
man is he to see?" "He is not easy to describe. There is something 
wrong with his appearance; something displeasing, something downright 
detestable. I never saw a man I so disliked, and yet I scarce know 
why. He must be deformed somewhere; he gives a strong feeling of 
deformity, although I couldn't specify the point. He's an 
extraordinary-looking man, and yet I really can name nothing out of 
the way. No, sir; I can make no hand of it; I can't describe him. And 
it's not want of memory; for I declare I can see him this moment." Mr. 
Utterson again walked some way in silence and obviously under a weight 
of consideration. "You are sure he used a key?" he inquired at last. 
"My dear sir..." began Enfield, surprised out of himself. 10) "Yes, I 
know," said Utterson; "I know it must seem strange. The fact is, if I 
do not ask you the name of the other party, it is because I know it 
already. You see, Richard, your tale has gone home. If you have been 
inexact in any point, you had better correct it." "I think you might 
have warned me," returned the other, with a touch of sullenness. "But 
I have been pedantically exact, as you call it. The fellow had a key; 
and what's more, he has it still. I saw him use it, not a week ago." 
Mr. Utterson sighed deeply but said never a word; and the young man 
presently resumed. "Here is another lesson to say nothing," said he. 
"I am ashamed of my long tongue. Let us make a bargain never to refer 
to this again." "With all my heart," said the lawyer. "I shake hands 
on that, Richard." 11)
                        SEARCH FOR MR. HYDE THAT evening Mr. Utterson 
came home to his bachelor house in sombre spirits and sat down to 
dinner without relish. It was his custom of a Sunday, when this meal 
was over, to sit close by the fire, a volume of some dry divinity on 
his reading-desk, until the clock of the neighbouring church rang out 
the hour of twelve, when he would go soberly and gratefully to bed. On 
this night, however, as soon as the cloth was taken away, he took up a 
candle and went into his business-room. There he opened his safe, took 
from the most private part of it a document endorsed on the envelope 
as Dr. Jekyll's Will, and sat down with a clouded brow to study its 
contents. The will was holograph, for Mr. Utterson, though he took 
charge of it now that it was made, had refused to lend the least 
assistance in the making of it; it provided not only that, in case of 
the decease of Henry Jekyll, M.D., D.C.L., L.L.D., F.R.S., etc., all 
his possessions were to pass into the hands of his "friend and 
benefactor Edward Hyde," but that in case of 12) Dr. Jekyll's 
"disappearance or unexplained absence for any period exceeding three 
calendar months," the said Edward Hyde should step into the said Henry 
Jekyll's shoes without further delay and free from any burthen or 
obligation, beyond the payment of a few small sums to the members of 
the doctor's household. This document had long been the lawyer's 
eyesore. It offended him both as a lawyer and as a lover of the sane 
and customary sides of life, to whom the fanciful was the immodest. 
And hitherto it was his ignorance of Mr. Hyde that had swelled his 
indignation; now, by a sudden turn, it was his knowledge. It was 
already bad enough when the name was but a name of which he could 
learn no more. It was worse when it began to be clothed upon with 
detestable attributes; and out of the shifting, insubstantial mists 
that had so long baffled his eye, there leaped up the sudden, definite 
presentment of a fiend. "I thought it was madness," he said, as he 
replaced the obnoxious paper in the safe, "and now I begin to fear it 
is disgrace." With that he blew out his candle, put on a great-coat, 
and set forth in the direction of Cavendish Square, that citadel of 
medicine, where his friend, the great Dr. Lanyon, had his house and 
received his crowding patients. "If any one knows, it will be Lanyon," 
he had thought. The solemn butler knew and welcomed him; 13) he was 
subjected to no stage of delay, but ushered direct from the door to 
the dining-room where Dr. Lanyon sat alone over his wine. This was a 
hearty, healthy, dapper, red-faced gentleman, with a shock of hair 
prematurely white, and a boisterous and decided manner. At sight of 
Mr. Utterson, he sprang up from his chair and welcomed him with both 
hands. The geniality, as was the way of the man, was somewhat 
theatrical to the eye; but it reposed on genuine feeling. For these 
two were old friends, old mates both at school and college, both 
thorough respecters of themselves and of each other, and, what does 
not always follow, men who thoroughly enjoyed each other's company. 
After a little rambling talk, the lawyer led up to the subject which 
so disagreeably pre-occupied his mind. "I suppose, Lanyon," said he 
"you and I must be the two oldest friends that Henry Jekyll has?" "I 
wish the friends were younger," chuckled Dr. Lanyon. "But I suppose we 
are. And what of that? I see little of him now." "Indeed?" said 
Utterson. "I thought you had a bond of common interest." "We had," was 
the reply. "But it is more than ten years since Henry Jekyll became 
too fanciful for me. He began to go wrong, wrong in mind; and though 
of course I continue to take an interest in him for old sake's sake, 
as they say, 14) I see and I have seen devilish little of the man. 
Such unscientific balderdash," added the doctor, flushing suddenly 
purple, "would have estranged Damon and Pythias." This little spirit 
of temper was somewhat of a relief to Mr. Utterson. "They have only 
differed on some point of science," he thought; and being a man of no 
scientific passions (except in the matter of conveyancing), he even 
added: "It is nothing worse than that!" He gave his friend a few 
seconds to recover his composure, and then approached the question he 
had come to put. "Did you ever come across a protege of his--one 
Hyde?" he asked. "Hyde?" repeated Lanyon. "No. Never heard of him. 
Since my time." That was the amount of information that the lawyer 
carried back with him to the great, dark bed on which he tossed to and 
fro, until the small hours of the morning began to grow large. It was 
a night of little ease to his toiling mind, toiling in mere darkness 
and besieged by questions. Six o'clock struck on the bells of the 
church that was so conveniently near to Mr. Utterson's dwelling, and 
still he was digging at the problem. Hitherto it had touched him on 
the intellectual side alone; but now his imagination also was engaged, 
or rather enslaved; and as he lay and tossed in the gross darkness of 
the night and the curtained room, Mr. Enfield's tale went by 15) 
before his mind in a scroll of lighted pictures. He would be aware of 
the great field of lamps of a nocturnal city; then of the figure of a 
man walking swiftly; then of a child running from the doctor's; and 
then these met, and that human Juggernaut trod the child down and 
passed on regardless of her screams. Or else he would see a room in a 
rich house, where his friend lay asleep, dreaming and smiling at his 
dreams; and then the door of that room would be opened, the curtains 
of the bed plucked apart, the sleeper recalled, and lo! there would 
stand by his side a figure to whom power was given, and even at that 
dead hour, he must rise and do its bidding. The figure in these two 
phases haunted the lawyer all night; and if at any time he dozed over, 
it was but to see it glide more stealthily through sleeping houses, or 
move the more swiftly and still the more swiftly, even to dizziness, 
through wider labyrinths of lamplighted city, and at every 
street-corner crush a child and leave her screaming. And still the 
figure had no face by which he might know it; even in his dreams, it 
had no face, or one that baffled him and melted before his eyes; and 
thus it was that there sprang up and grew apace in the lawyer's mind a 
singularly strong, almost an inordinate, curiosity to behold the 
features of the real Mr. Hyde. If he could but once set eyes on him, 
he thought the mystery would lighten and perhaps roll altogether away, 
as was the habit of mysterious 16) things when well examined. He might 
see a reason for his friend's strange preference or bondage (call it 
which you please) and even for the startling clause of the will. At 
least it would be a face worth seeing: the face of a man who was 
without bowels of mercy: a face which had but to show itself to raise 
up, in the mind of the unimpressionable Enfield, a spirit of enduring 
hatred. From that time forward, Mr. Utterson began to haunt the door 
in the by-street of shops. In the morning before office hours, at noon 
when business was plenty, and time scarce, at night under the face of 
the fogged city moon, by all lights and at all hours of solitude or 
concourse, the lawyer was to be found on his chosen post. "If he be 
Mr. Hyde," he had thought, "I shall be Mr. Seek." And at last his 
patience was rewarded. It was a fine dry night; frost in the air; the 
streets as clean as a ballroom floor; the lamps, unshaken, by any 
wind, drawing a regular pattern of light and shadow. By ten o'clock, 
when the shops were closed, the by-street was very solitary and, in 
spite of the low growl of London from all round, very silent. Small 
sounds carried far; domestic sounds out of the houses were clearly 
audible on either side of the roadway; and the rumour of the approach 
of any passenger preceded him by a long time. Mr. Utterson had been 
some minutes at his post, when he was 17) aware of an odd, light 
footstep drawing near. In the course of his nightly patrols, he had 
long grown accustomed to the quaint effect with which the footfalls of 
a single person, while he is still a great way off, suddenly spring 
out distinct from the vast hum and clatter of the city. Yet his 
attention had never before been so sharply and decisively arrested; 
and it was with a strong, superstitious prevision of success that he 
withdrew into the entry of the court. The steps drew swiftly nearer, 
and swelled out suddenly louder as they turned the end of the street. 
The lawyer, looking forth from the entry, could soon see what manner 
of man he had to deal with. He was small and very plainly dressed, and 
the look of him, even at that distance, went somehow strongly against 
the watcher's inclination. But he made straight for the door, crossing 
the roadway to save time; and as he came, he drew a key from his 
pocket like one approaching home. Mr. Utterson stepped out and touched 
him on the shoulder as he passed. "Mr. Hyde, I think?" Mr. Hyde shrank 
back with a hissing intake of the breath. But his fear was only 
momentary; and though he did not look the lawyer in the face, he 
answered coolly enough: "That is my name. What do you want?" "I see 
you are going in," returned the lawyer. "I am an old friend of Dr. 
Jekyll's--Mr. Utter- 18) son of Gaunt Street--you must have heard my 
name; and meeting you so conveniently, I thought you might admit me." 
"You will not find Dr. Jekyll; he is from home," replied Mr. Hyde, 
blowing in the key. And then suddenly, but still without looking up, 
"How did you know me?" he asked. "On your side," said Mr. Utterson, 
"will you do me a favour?" "With pleasure," replied the other. "What 
shall it be?" "Will you let me see your face?" asked the lawyer. Mr. 
Hyde appeared to hesitate, and then, as if upon some sudden 
reflection, fronted about with an air of defiance; and the pair stared 
at each other pretty fixedly for a few seconds. "Now I shall know you 
again," said Mr. Utterson. "It may be useful." "Yes," returned Mr. 
Hyde, "it is as well we have, met; and a propos, you should have my 
address." And he gave a number of a street in Soho. "Good God!" 
thought Mr. Utterson, "can he, too, have been thinking of the will?" 
But he kept his feelings to himself and only grunted in acknowledgment 
of the address. "And now," said the other, "how did you know me?" "By 
description," was the reply. "Whose description?" 19) "We have common 
friends," said Mr. Utterson. "Common friends?" echoed Mr. Hyde, a 
little hoarsely. "Who are they?" "Jekyll, for instance," said the 
lawyer. "He never told you," cried Mr. Hyde, with a flush of anger. "I 
did not think you would have lied." "Come," said Mr. Utterson, "that 
is not fitting language." The other snarled aloud into a savage laugh; 
and the next moment, with extraordinary quickness, he had unlocked the 
door and disappeared into the house. The lawyer stood awhile when Mr. 
Hyde had left him, the picture of disquietude. Then he began slowly to 
mount the street, pausing every step or two and putting his hand to 
his brow like a man in mental perplexity. The problem he was thus 
debating as he walked, was one of a class that is rarely solved. Mr. 
Hyde was pale and dwarfish, he gave an impression of deformity without 
any nameable malformation, he had a displeasing smile, he had borne 
himself to the lawyer with a sort of murderous mixture of timidity and 
boldness, and he spoke with a husky, whispering and somewhat broken 
voice; all these were points against him, but not all of these 
together could explain the hitherto unknown disgust, loathing, and 
fear with which Mr. Utterson regarded him. "There must be some- 20) 
thing else," said the perplexed gentleman. "There is something more, 
if I could find a name for it. God bless me, the man seems hardly 
human! Something troglodytic, shall we say? or can it be the old story 
of Dr. Fell? or is it the mere radiance of a foul soul that thus 
transpires through, and transfigures, its clay continent? The last, I 
think; for, O my poor old Harry Jekyll, if ever I read Satan's 
signature upon a face, it is on that of your new friend." Round the 
corner from the by-street, there was a square of ancient, handsome 
houses, now for the most part decayed from their high estate and let 
in flats and chambers to all sorts and conditions of men: 
map-engravers, architects, shady lawyers, and the agents of obscure 
enterprises. One house, however, second from the corner, was still 
occupied entire; and at the door of this, which wore a great air of 
wealth and comfort, though it was now plunged in darkness except for 
the fan-light, Mr. Utterson stopped and knocked. A well-dressed, 
elderly servant opened the door. "Is Dr. Jekyll at home, Poole?" asked 
the lawyer. "I will see, Mr. Utterson," said Poole, admitting the 
visitor, as he spoke, into a large, low-roofed, comfortable hall, 
paved with flags, warmed (after the fashion of a country house) by a 
bright, open fire, and furnished with costly cabinets of oak. "Will 
you wait here by the 21) fire, sir? or shall I give you a light in the 
dining room?" "Here, thank you," said the lawyer, and he drew near and 
leaned on the tall fender. This hall, in which he was now left alone, 
was a pet fancy of his friend the doctor's; and Utterson himself was 
wont to speak of it as the pleasantest room in London. But to-night 
there was a shudder in his blood; the face of Hyde sat heavy on his 
memory; he felt (what was rare with him) a nausea and distaste of 
life; and in the gloom of his spirits, he seemed to read a menace in 
the flickering of the firelight on the polished cabinets and the 
uneasy starting of the shadow on the roof. He was ashamed of his 
relief, when Poole presently returned to announce that Dr. Jekyll was 
gone out. "I saw Mr. Hyde go in by the old dissecting-room door, 
Poole," he said. "Is that right, when Dr. Jekyll is from home?" "Quite 
right, Mr. Utterson, sir," replied the servant. "Mr. Hyde has a key." 
"Your master seems to repose a great deal of trust in that young man, 
Poole," resumed the other musingly. "Yes, sir, he do indeed," said 
Poole. "We have all orders to obey him." "I do not think I ever met 
Mr. Hyde?" asked Utterson. "O, dear no, sir. He never dines here," 
replied the butler. "Indeed we see very little of 22) him on this side 
of the house; he mostly comes and goes by the laboratory." "Well, 
good-night, Poole." "Good-night, Mr. Utterson." And the lawyer set out 
homeward with a very heavy heart. "Poor Harry Jekyll," he thought, "my 
mind misgives me he is in deep waters! He was wild when he was young; 
a long while ago to be sure; but in the law of God, there is no 
statute of limitations. Ay, it must be that; the ghost of some old 
sin, the cancer of some concealed disgrace: punishment coming, PEDE 
CLAUDO, years after memory has forgotten and self-love condoned the 
fault." And the lawyer, scared by the thought, brooded a while on his 
own past, groping in all the corners of memory, lest by chance some 
Jack-in-the-Box of an old iniquity should leap to light there. His 
past was fairly blameless; few men could read the rolls of their life 
with less apprehension; yet he was humbled to the dust by the many ill 
things he had done, and raised up again into a sober and fearful 
gratitude by the many that he had come so near to doing, yet avoided. 
And then by a return on his former subject, he conceived a spark of 
hope. "This Master Hyde, if he were studied," thought he, "must have 
secrets of his own; black secrets, by the look of him; secrets 
compared to which poor Jekyll's worst would be like sunshine. Things 
cannot continue as they are. It turns me cold to think of this 
creature stealing like a 23) thief to Harry's bedside; poor Harry, 
what a wakening! And the danger of it; for if this Hyde suspects the 
existence of the will, he may grow impatient to inherit. Ay, I must 
put my shoulder to the wheel if Jekyll will but let me," he added, "if 
Jekyll will only let me." For once more he saw before his mind's eye, 
as clear as a transparency, the strange clauses of the will. 24)
                      DR. JEKYLL WAS QUITE AT EASE A FORTNIGHT later, 
by excellent good fortune, the doctor gave one of his pleasant dinners 
to some five or six old cronies, all intelligent, reputable men and 
all judges of good wine; and Mr. Utterson so contrived that he 
remained behind after the others had departed. This was no new 
arrangement, but a thing that had befallen many scores of times. Where 
Utterson was liked, he was liked well. Hosts loved to detain the dry 
lawyer, when the light-hearted and the loose-tongued had already their 
foot on the threshold; they liked to sit a while in his unobtrusive 
company, practising for solitude, sobering their minds in the man's 
rich silence after the expense and strain of gaiety. To this rule, Dr. 
Jekyll was no exception; and as he now sat on the opposite side of the 
fire--a large, well-made, smooth-faced man of fifty, with something of 
a slyish cast perhaps, but every mark of capacity and kindness--you 
could see by his looks that he cherished for Mr. Utterson a sincere 
and warm affection. 25) "I have been wanting to speak to you, Jekyll," 
began the latter. "You know that will of yours?" A close observer 
might have gathered that the topic was distasteful; but the doctor 
carried it off gaily. "My poor Utterson," said he, "you are 
unfortunate in such a client. I never saw a man so distressed as you 
were by my will; unless it were that hide-bound pedant, Lanyon, at 
what he called my scientific heresies. Oh, I know he's a good 
fellow--you needn't frown--an excellent fellow, and I always mean to 
see more of him; but a hide-bound pedant for all that; an ignorant, 
blatant pedant. I was never more disappointed in any man than Lanyon." 
"You know I never approved of it," pursued Utterson, ruthlessly 
disregarding the fresh topic. "My will? Yes, certainly, I know that," 
said the doctor, a trifle sharply. "You have told me so." "Well, I 
tell you so again," continued the lawyer. "I have been learning 
something of young Hyde." The large handsome face of Dr. Jekyll grew 
pale to the very lips, and there came a blackness about his eyes. "I 
do not care to hear more," said he. "This is a matter I thought we had 
agreed to drop." "What I heard was abominable," said Utterson. "It can 
make no change. You do not under- 26) stand my position," returned the 
doctor, with a certain incoherency of manner. "I am painfully 
situated, Utterson; my position is a very strange--a very strange one. 
It is one of those affairs that cannot be mended by talking." 
"Jekyll," said Utterson, "you know me: I am a man to be trusted. Make 
a clean breast of this in confidence; and I make no doubt I can get 
you out of it." "My good Utterson," said the doctor, "this is very 
good of you, this is downright good of you, and I cannot find words to 
thank you in. I believe you fully; I would trust you before any man 
alive, ay, before myself, if I could make the choice; but indeed it 
isn't what you fancy; it is not so bad as that; and just to put your 
good heart at rest, I will tell you one thing: the moment I choose, I 
can be rid of Mr. Hyde. I give you my hand upon that; and I thank you 
again and again; and I will just add one little word, Utterson, that 
I'm sure you'll take in good part: this is a private matter, and I beg 
of you to let it sleep." Utterson reflected a little, looking in the 
fire. "I have no doubt you are perfectly right," he said at last, 
getting to his feet. "Well, but since we have touched upon this 
business, and for the last time I hope," continued the doctor, "there 
is one point I should like you to understand. I have really a very 
great interest in poor Hyde. I know you have seen 27) him; he told me 
so; and I fear he was rude. But, I do sincerely take a great, a very 
great interest in that young man; and if I am taken away, Utterson, I 
wish you to promise me that you will bear with him and get his rights 
for him. I think you would, if you knew all; and it would be a weight 
off my mind if you would promise." "I can't pretend that I shall ever 
like him," said the lawyer. "I don't ask that," pleaded Jekyll, laying 
his hand upon the other's arm; "I only ask for justice; I only ask you 
to help him for my sake, when I am no longer here." Utterson heaved an 
irrepressible sigh. "Well," said he, "I promise." 28)
                      THE CAREW MURDER CASE NEARLY a year later, in 
the month of October, 18---, London was startled by a crime of 
singular ferocity and rendered all the more notable by the high 
position of the victim. The details were few and startling. A maid 
servant living alone in a house not far from the river, had gone 
up-stairs to bed about eleven. Although a fog rolled over the city in 
the small hours, the early part of the night was cloudless, and the 
lane, which the maid's window overlooked, was brilliantly lit by the 
full moon. It seems she was romantically given, for she sat down upon 
her box, which stood immediately under the window, and fell into a 
dream of musing. Never (she used to say, with streaming tears, when 
she narrated that experience), never had she felt more at peace with 
all men or thought more kindly of the world. And as she so sat she 
became aware of an aged and beautiful gentleman with white hair, 
drawing near along the lane; and advancing to meet him, another and 
very small gentleman, to whom at first she 29) paid less attention. 
When they had come within speech (which was just under the maid's 
eyes) the older man bowed and accosted the other with a very pretty 
manner of politeness. It did not seem as if the subject of his address 
were of great importance; indeed, from his pointing, it sometimes 
appeared as if he were only inquiring his way; but the moon shone on 
his face as he spoke, and the girl was pleased to watch it, it seemed 
to breathe such an innocent and old-world kindness of disposition, yet 
with something high too, as of a well-founded self-content. Presently 
her eye wandered to the other, and she was surprised to recognise in 
him a certain Mr. Hyde, who had once visited her master and for whom 
she had conceived a dislike. He had in his hand a heavy cane, with 
which he was trifling; but he answered never a word, and seemed to 
listen with an ill-contained impatience. And then all of a sudden he 
broke out in a great flame of anger, stamping with his foot, 
brandishing the cane, and carrying on (as the maid described it) like 
a madman. The old gentleman took a step back, with the air of one very 
much surprised and a trifle hurt; and at that Mr. Hyde broke out of 
all bounds and clubbed him to the earth. And next moment, with 
ape-like fury, he was trampling his victim under foot and hailing down 
a storm of blows, under which the bones were audibly shattered and the 
body jumped upon the roadway. At the horror of these sights and 
sounds, the maid fainted. 30) It was two o'clock when she came to 
herself and called for the police. The murderer was gone long ago; but 
there lay his victim in the middle of the lane, incredibly mangled. 
The stick with which the deed had been done, although it was of some 
rare and very tough and heavy wood, had broken in the middle under the 
stress of this insensate cruelty; and one splintered half had rolled 
in the neighbouring gutter--the other, without doubt, had been carried 
away by the murderer. A purse and a gold watch were found upon the 
victim: but no cards or papers, except a sealed and stamped envelope, 
which he had been probably carrying to the post, and which bore the 
name and address of Mr. Utterson. This was brought to the lawyer the 
next morning, before he was out of bed; and he had no sooner seen it, 
and been told the circumstances, than he shot out a solemn lip. "I 
shall say nothing till I have seen the body," said he; "this may be 
very serious. Have the kindness to wait while I dress." And with the 
same grave countenance he hurried through his breakfast and drove to 
the police station, whither the body had been carried. As soon as he 
came into the cell, he nodded. "Yes," said he, "I recognise him. I am 
sorry to say that this is Sir Danvers Carew." "Good God, sir," 
exclaimed the officer, "is it possible?" And the next moment his eye 
31) lighted up with professional ambition. "This will make a deal of 
noise," he said. "And perhaps you can help us to the man." And he 
briefly narrated what the maid had seen, and showed the broken stick. 
Mr. Utterson had already quailed at the name of Hyde; but when the 
stick was laid before him, he could doubt no longer; broken and 
battered as it was, he recognised it for one that he had himself 
presented many years before to Henry Jekyll. "Is this Mr. Hyde a 
person of small stature?" he inquired. "Particularly small and 
particularly wicked-looking, is what the maid calls him," said the 
officer. Mr. Utterson reflected; and then, raising his head, "If you 
will come with me in my cab," he said, "I think I can take you to his 
house." It was by this time about nine in the morning, and the first 
fog of the season. A great chocolate-coloured pall lowered over 
heaven, but the wind was continually charging and routing these 
embattled vapours; so that as the cab crawled from street to street, 
Mr. Utterson beheld a marvellous number of degrees and hues of 
twilight; for here it would be dark like the back-end of evening; and 
there would be a glow of a rich, lurid brown, like the light of some 
strange conflagration; and here, for a moment, the fog would be quite 
broken up, and a haggard shaft 32) of daylight would glance in between 
the swirling wreaths. The dismal quarter of Soho seen under these 
changing glimpses, with its muddy ways, and slatternly passengers, and 
its lamps, which had never been extinguished or had been kindled 
afresh to combat this mournful re-invasion of darkness, seemed, in the 
lawyer's eyes, like a district of some city in a nightmare. The 
thoughts of his mind, besides, were of the gloomiest dye; and when he 
glanced at the companion of his drive, he was conscious of some touch 
of that terror of the law and the law's officers, which may at times 
assail the most honest. As the cab drew up before the address 
indicated, the fog lifted a little and showed him a dingy street, a 
gin palace, a low French eating-house, a shop for the retail of penny 
numbers and twopenny salads, many ragged children huddled in the 
doorways, and many women of different nationalities passing out, key 
in hand, to have a morning glass; and the next moment the fog settled 
down again upon that part, as brown as umber, and cut him off from his 
blackguardly surroundings. This was the home of Henry Jekyll's 
favourite; of a man who was heir to a quarter of a million sterling. 
An ivory-faced and silvery-haired old woman opened the door. She had 
an evil face, smoothed by hypocrisy; but her manners were excellent. 
Yes, she said, this was Mr. Hyde's, but he was not at home; he had 
been in that night very late, 33) but had gone away again in less than 
an hour; there was nothing strange in that; his habits were very 
irregular, and he was often absent; for instance, it was nearly two 
months since she had seen him till yesterday. "Very well, then, we 
wish to see his rooms," said the lawyer; and when the woman began to 
declare it was impossible, "I had better tell you who this person is," 
he added. "This is Inspector Newcomen of Scotland Yard." A flash of 
odious joy appeared upon the woman's face. "Ah!" said she, "he is in 
trouble! What has he done?" Mr. Utterson and the inspector exchanged 
glances. "He don't seem a very popular character," observed the 
latter. "And now, my good woman, just let me and this gentleman have a 
look about us." In the whole extent of the house, which but for the 
old woman remained otherwise empty, Mr. Hyde had only used a couple of 
rooms; but these were furnished with luxury and good taste. A closet 
was filled with wine; the plate was of silver, the napery elegant; a 
good picture hung upon the walls, a gift (as Utterson supposed) from 
Henry Jekyll, who was much of a connoisseur; and the carpets were of 
many plies and agreeable in colour. At this moment, however, the rooms 
bore every mark of having been recently and hurriedly ransacked; 
clothes lay about the floor, with their pockets inside out; 34) 
lock-fast drawers stood open; and on the hearth there lay a pile of 
grey ashes, as though many papers had been burned. From these embers 
the inspector disinterred the butt-end of a green cheque-book, which 
had resisted the action of the fire; the other half of the stick was 
found behind the door; and as this clinched his suspicions, the 
officer declared himself delighted. A visit to the bank, where several 
thousand pounds were found to be lying to the murderer's credit, 
completed his gratification. "You may depend upon it, sir," he told 
Mr. Utterson: "I have him in my hand. He must have lost his head, or 
he never would have left the stick or, above all, burned the 
cheque-book. Why, money's life to the man. We have nothing to do but 
wait for him at the bank, and get out the handbills." This last, 
however, was not so easy of accomplishment; for Mr. Hyde had numbered 
few familiars--even the master of the servant-maid had only seen him 
twice; his family could nowhere be traced; he had never been 
photographed; and the few who could describe him differed widely, as 
common observers will. Only on one point, were they agreed; and that 
was the haunting sense of unexpressed deformity with which the 
fugitive impressed his beholders. 35)
                     INCIDENT OF THE LETTER IT was late in the 
afternoon, when Mr. Utterson found his way to Dr. Jekyll's door, where 
he was at once admitted by Poole, and carried down by the kitchen 
offices and across a yard which had once been a garden, to the 
building which was indifferently known as the laboratory or the 
dissecting-rooms. The doctor had bought the house from the heirs of a 
celebrated surgeon; and his own tastes being rather chemical than 
anatomical, had changed the destination of the block at the bottom of 
the garden. It was the first time that the lawyer had been received in 
that part of his friend's quarters; and he eyed the dingy, windowless 
structure with curiosity, and gazed round with a distasteful sense of 
strangeness as he crossed the theatre, once crowded with eager 
students and now lying gaunt and silent, the tables laden with 
chemical apparatus, the floor strewn with crates and littered with 
packing straw, and the light falling dimly through the foggy cupola. 
At the further end, a flight of stairs mounted to a door covered with 
red baize; 36) and through this, Mr. Utterson was at last received 
into the doctor's cabinet. It was a large room, fitted round with 
glass presses, furnished, among other things, with a cheval-glass and 
a business table, and looking out upon the court by three dusty 
windows barred with iron. A fire burned in the grate; a lamp was set 
lighted on the chimney shelf, for even in the houses the fog began to 
lie thickly; and there, close up to the warmth, sat Dr. Jekyll, 
looking deadly sick. He did not rise to meet his visitor, but held out 
a cold hand and bade him welcome in a changed voice. "And now," said 
Mr. Utterson, as soon as Poole had left them, "you have heard the 
news?" The doctor shuddered. "They were crying it in the square," he 
said. "I heard them in my dining-room." "One word," said the lawyer. 
"Carew was my client, but so are you, and I want to know what I am 
doing. You have not been mad enough to hide this fellow?" "Utterson, I 
swear to God," cried the doctor, "I swear to God I will never set eyes 
on him again. I bind my honour to you that I am done with him in this 
world. It is all at an end. And indeed he does not want my help; you 
do not know him as I do; he is safe, he is quite safe; mark my words, 
he will never more be heard of." The lawyer listened gloomily; he did 
not like his friend's feverish manner. "You seem pretty 37) sure of 
him," said he; "and for your sake, I hope you may be right. If it came 
to a trial, your name might appear." "I am quite sure of him," replied 
Jekyll; "I have grounds for certainty that I cannot share with any 
one. But there is one thing on which you may advise me. I have--I have 
received a letter; and I am at a loss whether I should show it to the 
police. I should like to leave it in your hands, Utterson; you would 
judge wisely, I am sure; I have so great a trust in you." "You fear, I 
suppose, that it might lead to his detection?" asked the lawyer. "No," 
said the other. "I cannot say that I care what becomes of Hyde; I am 
quite done with him. I was thinking of my own character, which this 
hateful business has rather exposed." Utterson ruminated a while; he 
was surprised at his friend's selfishness, and yet relieved by it. 
"Well," said he, at last, "let me see the letter." The letter was 
written in an odd, upright hand and signed "Edward Hyde": and it 
signified, briefly enough, that the writer's benefactor, Dr. Jekyll, 
whom he had long so unworthily repaid for a thousand generosities, 
need labour under no alarm for his safety, as he had means of escape 
on which he placed a sure dependence. The lawyer liked this letter 
well enough; it put a better colour on the intimacy than he had looked 
for; and he blamed himself for some of his past suspicions. 38) "Have 
you the envelope?" he asked. "I burned it," replied Jekyll, "before I 
thought what I was about. But it bore no postmark. The note was handed 
in." "Shall I keep this and sleep upon it?" asked Utterson. "I wish 
you to judge for me entirely," was the reply. "I have lost confidence 
in myself." "Well, I shall consider," returned the lawyer. "And now 
one word more: it was Hyde who dictated the terms in your will about 
that disappearance?" The doctor seemed seized with a qualm of 
faintness: he shut his mouth tight and nodded. "I knew it," said 
Utterson. "He meant to murder you. You have had a fine escape." "I 
have had what is far more to the purpose," returned the doctor 
solemnly: "I have had a lesson--O God, Utterson, what a lesson I have 
had!" And he covered his face for a moment with his hands. On his way 
out, the lawyer stopped and had a word or two with Poole. "By the by," 
said he, "there was a letter handed in to-day: what was the messenger 
like?" But Poole was positive nothing had come except by post; "and 
only circulars by that," he added. This news sent off the visitor with 
his fears renewed. Plainly the letter had come by the laboratory door; 
possibly, indeed, it had been 39) written in the cabinet; and if that 
were so, it must be differently judged, and handled with the more 
caution. The newsboys, as he went, were crying themselves hoarse along 
the footways: "Special edition. Shocking murder of an M. P." That was 
the funeral oration of one friend and client; and he could not help a 
certain apprehension lest the good name of another should be sucked 
down in the eddy of the scandal. It was, at least, a ticklish decision 
that he had to make; and self-reliant as he was by habit, he began to 
cherish a longing for advice. It was not to be had directly; but 
perhaps, he thought, it might be fished for. Presently after, he sat 
on one side of his own hearth, with Mr. Guest, his head clerk, upon 
the other, and midway between, at a nicely calculated distance from 
the fire, a bottle of a particular old wine that had long dwelt 
unsunned in the foundations of his house. The fog still slept on the 
wing above the drowned city, where the lamps glimmered like 
carbuncles; and through the muffle and smother of these fallen clouds, 
the procession of the town's life was still rolling in through the 
great arteries with a sound as of a mighty wind. But the room was gay 
with firelight. In the bottle the acids were long ago resolved; the 
imperial dye had softened with time, As the colour grows richer in 
stained windows; and the glow of hot autumn afternoons on hillside 
vineyards was ready to be set free 40) and to disperse the fogs of 
London. Insensibly the lawyer melted. There was no man from whom he 
kept fewer secrets than Mr. Guest; and he was not always sure that he 
kept as many as he meant. Guest had often been on business to the 
doctor's; he knew Poole; he could scarce have failed to hear of Mr. 
Hyde's familiarity about the house; he might draw conclusions: was it 
not as well, then, that he should see a letter which put that mystery 
to rights? and above all since Guest, being a great student and critic 
of handwriting, would consider the step natural and obliging? The 
clerk, besides, was a man of counsel; he would scarce read so strange 
a document without dropping a remark; and by that remark Mr. Utterson 
might shape his future course. "This is a sad business about Sir 
Danvers," he said. "Yes, sir, indeed. It has elicited a great deal of 
public feeling," returned Guest. "The man, of course, was mad." "I 
should like to hear your views on that," replied Utterson. "I have a 
document here in his handwriting; it is between ourselves, for I 
scarce know what to do about it; it is an ugly business at the best. 
But there it is; quite in your way a murderer's autograph." Guest's 
eyes brightened, and he sat down at once and studied it with passion. 
"No, sir," he said: "not mad; but it is an odd hand." 41) "And by all 
accounts a very odd writer," added the lawyer. Just then the servant 
entered with a note. "Is that from Dr. Jekyll, sir?" inquired the 
clerk. "I thought I knew the writing. Anything private, Mr. Utterson?" 
"Only an invitation to dinner. Why? Do you want to see it?" "One 
moment. I thank you, sir"; and the clerk laid the two sheets of paper 
alongside and sedulously compared their contents. "Thank you, sir," he 
said at last, returning both; "it's a very interesting autograph." 
There was a pause, during which Mr. Utterson struggled with himself. 
"Why did you compare them, Guest?" he inquired suddenly. "Well, sir," 
returned the clerk, "there's a rather singular resemblance; the two 
hands are in many points identical: only differently sloped." "Rather 
quaint," said Utterson. "It is, as you say, rather quaint," returned 
Guest. "I wouldn't speak of this note, you know," said the master. 
"No, sir," said the clerk. "I understand." But no sooner was Mr. 
Utterson alone that night than he locked the note into his safe, where 
it reposed from that time forward. "What!" he thought. "Henry Jekyll 
forge for a murderer!" And his blood ran cold in his veins. 42)
                     REMARKABLE INCIDENT OF DR. LANYON TIME ran on; 
thousands of pounds were offered in reward, for the death of Sir 
Danvers was resented as a public injury; but Mr. Hyde had disappeared 
out of the ken of the police as though he had never existed. Much of 
his past was unearthed, indeed, and all disreputable: tales came out 
of the man's cruelty, at once so callous and violent; of his vile 
life, of his strange associates, of the hatred that seemed to have 
surrounded his career; but of his present whereabouts, not a whisper. 
From the time he had left the house in Soho on the morning of the 
murder, he was simply blotted out; and gradually, as time drew on, Mr. 
Utterson began to recover from the hotness of his alarm, and to grow 
more at quiet with himself. The death of Sir Danvers was, to his way 
of thinking, more than paid for by the disappearance of Mr. Hyde. Now 
that that evil influence had been withdrawn, a new life began for Dr. 
Jekyll. He came out of his seclusion, renewed relations with his 
friends, became once more their familiar guest 43) and entertainer; 
and whilst he had always been known for charities, he was now no less 
distinguished for religion. He was busy, he was much in the open air, 
he did good; his face seemed to open and brighten, as if with an 
inward consciousness of service; and for more than two months, the 
doctor was at peace. On the 8th of January Utterson had dined at the 
doctor's with a small party; Lanyon had been there; and the face of 
the host had looked from one to the other as in the old days when the 
trio were inseparable friends. On the 12th, and again on the 14th, the 
door was shut against the lawyer. "The doctor was confined to the 
house," Poole said, "and saw no one." On the 15th, he tried again, and 
was again refused; and having now been used for the last two months to 
see his friend almost daily, he found this return of solitude to weigh 
upon his spirits. The fifth night he had in Guest to dine with him; 
and the sixth he betook himself to Dr. Lanyon's. There at least he was 
not denied admittance; but when he came in, he was shocked at the 
change which had taken place in the doctor's appearance. He had his 
death-warrant written legibly upon his face. The rosy man had grown 
pale; his flesh had fallen away; he was visibly balder and older; and 
yet it was not so much, these tokens of a swift physical decay that 
arrested the lawyer's notice, as a look in the eye and quality of 
manner that seemed to testify to 44) some deep-seated terror of the 
mind. It was unlikely that the doctor should fear death; and yet that 
was what Utterson was tempted to suspect. "Yes," he thought; "he is a 
doctor, he must know his own state and that his days are counted; and 
the knowledge is more than he can bear." And yet when Utterson 
remarked on his ill-looks, it was with an air of greatness that Lanyon 
declared himself a doomed man. "I have had a shock," he said, "and I 
shall never recover. It is a question of weeks. Well, life has been 
pleasant; I liked it; yes, sir, I used to like it. I sometimes think 
if we knew all, we should be more glad to get away." "Jekyll is ill, 
too," observed Utterson. "Have you seen him?" But Lanyon's face 
changed, and he held up a trembling hand. "I wish to see or hear no 
more of Dr. Jekyll," he said in a loud, unsteady voice. "I am quite 
done with that person; and I beg that you will spare me any allusion 
to one whom I regard as dead." "Tut-tut," said Mr. Utterson; and then 
after a considerable pause, "Can't I do anything?" he inquired. "We 
are three very old friends, Lanyon; we shall not live to make others." 
"Nothing can be done," returned Lanyon; "ask himself." "He will not 
see me," said the lawyer. "I am not surprised at that," was the reply. 
"Some day, Utterson, after I am dead, you may 45) perhaps come to 
learn the right and wrong of this. I cannot tell you. And in the 
meantime, if you can sit and talk with me of other things, for God's 
sake, stay and do so; but if you cannot keep clear of this accursed 
topic, then, in God's name, go, for I cannot bear it." As soon as he 
got home, Utterson sat down and wrote to Jekyll, complaining of his 
exclusion from the house, and asking the cause of this unhappy break 
with Lanyon; and the next day brought him a long answer, often very 
pathetically worded, and sometimes darkly mysterious in drift. The 
quarrel with Lanyon was incurable. "I do not blame our old friend," 
Jekyll wrote, "but I share his view that we must never meet. I mean 
from henceforth to lead a life of extreme seclusion; you must not be 
surprised, nor must you doubt my friendship, if my door is often shut 
even to you. You must suffer me to go my own dark way. I have brought 
on myself a punishment and a danger that I cannot name. If I am the 
chief of sinners, I am the chief of sufferers also. I could not think 
that this earth contained a place for sufferings and terrors so 
unmanning; and you can do but one thing, Utterson, to lighten this 
destiny, and that is to respect my silence." Utterson was amazed; the 
dark influence of Hyde had been withdrawn, the doctor had returned to 
his old tasks and amities; a week ago, the prospect had smiled with 
every promise of a cheerful and an honoured age; 46) and now in a 
moment, friendship, and peace of mind, and the whole tenor of his life 
were wrecked. So great and unprepared a change pointed to madness; but 
in view of Lanyon's manner and words, there must lie for it some 
deeper ground. A week afterwards Dr. Lanyon took to his bed, and in 
something less than a fortnight he was dead. The night after the 
funeral, at which he had been sadly affected, Utterson locked the door 
of his business room, and sitting there by the light of a melancholy 
candle, drew out and set before him an envelope addressed by the hand 
and sealed with the seal of his dead friend. "PRIVATE: for the hands 
of G. J. Utterson ALONE and in case of his predecease to be destroyed 
unread," so it was emphatically superscribed; and the lawyer dreaded 
to behold the contents. "I have buried one friend to-day," he thought: 
"what if this should cost me another?" And then he condemned the fear 
as a disloyalty, and broke the seal. Within there was another 
enclosure, likewise sealed, and marked upon the cover as "not to be 
opened till the death or disappearance of Dr. Henry Jekyll." Utterson 
could not trust his eyes. Yes, it was disappearance; here again, as in 
the mad will which he had long ago restored to its author, here again 
were the idea of a disappearance and the name of Henry Jekyll 
bracketed. But in the will, that idea had sprung from the sinister 
suggestion of 47) the man Hyde; it was set there with a purpose all 
too plain and horrible. Written by the hand of Lanyon, what should it 
mean? A great curiosity came on the trustee, to disregard the 
prohibition and dive at once to the bottom of these mysteries; but 
professional honour and faith to his dead friend were stringent 
obligations; and the packet slept in the inmost corner of his private 
safe. It is one thing to mortify curiosity, another to conquer it; and 
it may be doubted if, from that day forth, Utterson desired the 
society of his surviving friend with the same eagerness. He thought of 
him kindly; but his thoughts were disquieted and fearful. He went to 
call indeed; but he was perhaps relieved to be denied admittance; 
perhaps, in his heart, he preferred to speak with Poole upon the 
doorstep and surrounded by the air and sounds of the open city, rather 
than to be admitted into that house of voluntary bondage, and to sit 
and speak with its inscrutable recluse. Poole had, indeed, no very 
pleasant news to communicate. The doctor, it appeared, now more than 
ever confined himself to the cabinet over the laboratory, where he 
would sometimes even sleep; he was out of spirits, he had grown very 
silent, he did not read; it seemed as if he had something on his mind. 
Utterson became so used to the unvarying character of these reports, 
that he fell off little by little in the frequency of his visits. 48)
                      INCIDENT AT THE WINDOW IT chanced on Sunday, 
when Mr. Utterson was on his usual walk with Mr. Enfield, that their 
way lay once again through the by-street; and that when they came in 
front of the door, both stopped to gaze on it. "Well," said Enfield, 
"that story's at an end at least. We shall never see more of Mr. 
Hyde." "I hope not," said Utterson. "Did I ever tell you that I once 
saw him, and shared your feeling of repulsion?" "It was impossible to 
do the one without the other," returned Enfield. "And by the way, what 
an ass you must have thought me, not to know that this was a back way 
to Dr. Jekyll's! It was partly your own fault that I found it out, 
even when I did." "So you found it out, did you?" said Utterson. "But 
if that be so, we may step into the court and take a look at the 
windows. To tell you the truth, I am uneasy about poor Jekyll; and 
even outside, I feel as if the presence of a friend might do him 
good." 49) The court was very cool and a little damp, and full of 
premature twilight, although the sky, high up overhead, was still 
bright with sunset. The middle one of the three windows was half-way 
open; and sitting close beside it, taking the air with an infinite 
sadness of mien, like some disconsolate prisoner, Utterson saw Dr. 
Jekyll. "What! Jekyll!" he cried. "I trust you are better." "I am very 
low, Utterson," replied the doctor, drearily, "very low. It will not 
last long, thank God." "You stay too much indoors," said the lawyer. 
"You should be out, whipping up the circulation like Mr. Enfield and 
me. (This is my cousin--Mr. Enfield--Dr. Jekyll.) Come, now; get your 
hat and take a quick turn with us." "You are very good," sighed the 
other. "I should like to very much; but no, no, no, it is quite 
impossible; I dare not. But indeed, Utterson, I am very glad to see 
you; this is really a great pleasure; I would ask you and Mr. Enfield 
up, but the place is really not fit." "Why then," said the lawyer, 
good-naturedly, "the best thing we can do is to stay down here and 
speak with you from where we are." "That is just what I was about to 
venture to propose," returned the doctor with a smile. But the words 
were hardly uttered, before the smile was struck out of his face and 
succeeded 50) by an expression of such abject terror and despair, as 
froze the very blood of the two gentlemen below. They saw it but for a 
glimpse, for the window was instantly thrust down; but that glimpse 
had been sufficient, and they turned and left the court without a 
word. In silence, too, they traversed the by-street; and it was not 
until they had come into a neighbouring thoroughfare, where even upon 
a Sunday there were still some stirrings of life, that Mr. Utterson at 
last turned and looked at his companion. They were both pale; and 
there was an answering horror in their eyes. "God forgive us, God 
forgive us," said Mr. Utterson. But Mr. Enfield only nodded his head 
very seriously and walked on once more in silence. 51)
                             THE LAST NIGHT MR. UTTERSON was sitting 
by his fireside one evening after dinner, when he was surprised to 
receive a visit from Poole. "Bless me, Poole, what brings you here?" 
he cried; and then taking a second look at him, "What ails you?" he 
added; "is the doctor ill?" "Mr. Utterson," said the man, "there is 
something wrong." "Take a seat, and here is a glass of wine for you," 
said the lawyer. "Now, take your time, and tell me plainly what you 
want." "You know the doctor's ways, sir," replied Poole, "and how he 
shuts himself up. Well, he's shut up again in the cabinet; and I don't 
like it, sir--I wish I may die if I like it. Mr. Utterson, sir, I'm 
afraid." "Now, my good man," said the lawyer, "be explicit. What are 
you afraid of?" "I've been afraid for about a week," returned Poole, 
doggedly disregarding the question, "and I can bear it no more." The 
man's appearance amply bore out his 52) words; his manner was altered 
for the worse; and except for the moment when he had first announced 
his terror, he had not once looked the lawyer in the face. Even now, 
he sat with the glass of wine untasted on his knee, and his eyes 
directed to a corner of the floor. "I can bear it no more," he 
repeated. "Come," said the lawyer, "I see you have some good reason, 
Poole; I see there is something seriously amiss. Try to tell me what 
it is." "I think there's been foul play," said Poole, hoarsely. "Foul 
play!" cried the lawyer, a good deal frightened and rather inclined to 
be irritated in consequence. "What foul play? What does the man mean?" 
"I daren't say, sir," was the answer; "but will you come along with me 
and see for yourself?" Mr. Utterson's only answer was to rise and get 
his hat and great-coat; but he observed with wonder the greatness of 
the relief that appeared upon the butler's face, and perhaps with no 
less, that the wine was still untasted when he set it down to follow. 
It was a wild, cold, seasonable night of March, with a pale moon, 
lying on her back as though the wind had tilted her, and a flying 
wrack of the most diaphanous and lawny texture. The wind made talking 
difficult, and flecked the blood into the face. It seemed to have 
swept the 53) streets unusually bare of passengers, besides; for Mr. 
Utterson thought he had never seen that part of London so deserted. He 
could have wished it otherwise; never in his life had he been 
conscious of so sharp a wish to see and touch his fellow-creatures; 
for struggle as he might, there was borne in upon his mind a crushing 
anticipation of calamity. The square, when they got there, was all 
full of wind and dust, and the thin trees in the garden were lashing 
themselves along the railing. Poole, who had kept all the way a pace 
or two ahead, now pulled up in the middle of the pavement, and in 
spite of the biting weather, took off his hat and mopped his brow with 
a red pocket-handkerchief. But for all the hurry of his coming, these 
were not the dews of exertion that he wiped away, but the moisture of 
some strangling anguish; for his face was white and his voice, when he 
spoke, harsh and broken. "Well, sir," he said, "here we are, and God 
grant there be nothing wrong." "Amen, Poole," said the lawyer. 
Thereupon the servant knocked in a very guarded manner; the door was 
opened on the chain; and a voice asked from within, "Is that you, 
Poole?" "It's all right," said Poole. "Open the door." The hall, when 
they entered it, was brightly lighted up; the fire was built high; and 
about the hearth the whole of the servants, men and 54) women, stood 
huddled together like a flock of sheep. At the sight of Mr. Utterson, 
the housemaid broke into hysterical whimpering; and the cook, crying 
out, "Bless God! it's Mr. Utterson," ran forward as if to take him in 
her arms. "What, what? Are you all here?" said the lawyer peevishly. 
"Very irregular, very unseemly; your master would be far from 
pleased." "They're all afraid," said Poole. Blank silence followed, no 
one protesting; only the maid lifted up her voice and now wept loudly. 
"Hold your tongue!" Poole said to her, with a ferocity of accent that 
testified to his own jangled nerves; and indeed, when the girl had so 
suddenly raised the note of her lamentation, they had all started and 
turned toward the inner door with faces of dreadful expectation. "And 
now," continued the butler, addressing the knife-boy, "reach me a 
candle, and we'll get this through hands at once." And then he begged 
Mr. Utterson to follow him,
and led the way to the back-garden.
